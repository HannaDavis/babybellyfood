            <p>When my son was old enough to start solid foods, I of course wanted to give him the very best food I could provide. I began by researching what 
            I should start with, which baby food brands were best, what exactly "fresh and organic" meant in the baby food world, and that is when I realized, 
            in order to give my baby the very best nutrition, I would have to make his food myself, plain and simple.The very first time I gave my baby food was 
            in the fall, butternut squash was everywhere and it made the prettiest, creamiest puree. He LOVED it... and from there, making baby food became a true 
            joy. Knowing that he was getting the healthiest, freshest food available, seeing him enjoy it, and thriving from it made me feel amazing.</p><br />
            <p>But, there were those days when I just couldn't find the time to make his three square meals a day; and those quick and easy pouches from the grocery 
            store were there, they were tasty and they were organic after all. So my baby got his fair share of the prepackaged pouches for sure. Even knowing 
            full well, that those baby food pouches were pretty much void of any real nutrient content being processed with extreme heat and having a shelf life 
            of up to THREE years, when I also knew that spinach (for example) looses its phytonutrient content by about 50% within just three DAYS of being picked 
            from the earth.</p> <br />
            <p>Or that an apple is NOT just an apple- depending on which variety of apple you cook with, you can literally diminish or increase the 
            sugar content of the food by about 80% along with the phytonutrients and antioxidants but, the big selling point with those pouches was that they 
            were just easy, and in those times when I needed the ease and convenience of premade baby food, what I really wished for was a baby food line that was
            truly fresh and local, but there wasn't anything like it. Until now! Baby Belly is a line of unique baby food that I created throughout the first year
            of my son eating solid foods.</p>
